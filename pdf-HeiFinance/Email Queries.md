To estimate your monthly repayment for refinancing under the HomeFlex Loan floating package, we need to know the loan amount and the specific spread applicable to your profile. The floating rate is pegged to 3M SORA plus a spread ranging between 0.80% and 1.20%. Rates reset quarterly.

For your reference:
• The loan-to-value limit is up to 75% for a first housing loan, and 55% if you have existing housing loans.
• The tenure is up to 30 years or until you reach 65 years old, whichever is earlier.
• A refinancing subsidy of up to SGD 2,000 for legal and valuation fees is available.

Q3:

Hi, can you tell me what the minimum deposit is for the HeiFinance SavingsPlus Account, and whether I can get bonus interest if I only spend $400 monthly on my credit card?

Yours sincerely,

Dear Eric Andrew,

Thank you for reaching out to HeiFinance Bank.

The minimum deposit requirement for the HeiFinance SavingsPlus Account is SGD 500. Regarding bonus interest, you would need to meet specific criteria. To earn the 0.75% bonus interest for eligible debit or credit card spending, the monthly spend needs to be at least SGD 500. Spending SGD 400 monthly on your credit card would not qualify for this particular bonus tier.

For your reference:
• Minimum initial deposit: SGD 500
• Bonus interest requires salary credit of at least SGD 2,000 OR eligible card spending of at least SGD 500 OR 3 recurring bill payments.
• Base interest is 0.05% p.a.

Q5:

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

What is the difference between floating and fixed loan rate offered by heifinance?

Warm regards,
David.

A5:

Dear David,

Thank you for reaching out to HeiFinance Bank.

The HeiFinance HomeFlex Loan offers two packages: a Fixed Rate Package where the interest rate is fixed for the first 3 years, providing predictable monthly installments, and a Floating Rate Package pegged to 3M SORA plus a spread, where rates reset quarterly and are suitable for those comfortable with fluctuations.

For your reference:
• Fixed Rate Package: Interest rate fixed for the first 3 years.
• Floating Rate Package: Pegged to 3M SORA plus a spread (0.80% to 1.20%).
• After the fixed period, the Fixed Rate Package reverts to the HeiFinance Board Rate (currently 3.5% p.a.) minus a customer discount.
