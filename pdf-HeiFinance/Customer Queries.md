# Query 3:
# How much cashback on the visa platinum card can i get if i spend 1000 on groceries, 800 on dining and 900 on online purchases?

Assistant:
The card offers 3% cashback on dining and supermarket spend. For other retail transactions, it offers 1% cashback.

Here's the calculation:
*   Groceries: SGD 1000 * 3% = SGD 30
*   Dining: SGD 800 * 3% = SGD 24
*   Online purchases (assuming these are "other retail transactions"): SGD 900 * 1% = SGD 9

Total cashback = SGD 30 + SGD 24 + SGD 9 = SGD 63. [Source 1]

# Query 4:
# What is the difference between floating and fixed loan rate offered by heifinance?

Assistant:
The HeiFinance HomeFlex Loan offers two packages: a Fixed Rate Package and a Floating Rate Package.

The Fixed Rate Package has an interest rate that is fixed for the first 3 years. After this period, the rate reverts to the HeiFinance Board Rate (currently 3.5% p.a.) minus a customer discount. This package provides certainty in monthly installments and is suitable for those who prefer predictability [Source 1].

The Floating Rate Package is pegged to 3M SORA plus a spread ranging between 0.80% and 1.20%. The rates reset quarterly according to SORA movement. This package is suitable for customers who are comfortable with fluctuations in exchange for potentially lower costs [Source 1, Source 4].
